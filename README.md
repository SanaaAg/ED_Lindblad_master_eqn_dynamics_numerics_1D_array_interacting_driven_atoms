# ED_dynamics_numerics_1Darray_interacting_driven_atoms
 
Numerically solves the Lindblad master equation exactly using the exact diagonalization approach (ED) to dynamically evolve a driven 1D array of 4 level atoms interacting via dipolar interactions with correlated dissipation. Calculates Toth's spin squeezing parameter and logarithmic negativity, which are witnesses of bi-partitite entanglement.
