# ED_Unitary_dynamics_numerics_1D_and_2D_array_interacting_driven_atoms
 
Numerically solves the equations of motion exactly using the exact diagonalization approach (ED) to dynamically evolve a driven 2D array of 2 level atoms interacting via dipolar interactions, which amounts to an inhomogeneous and anisotropic XY model
